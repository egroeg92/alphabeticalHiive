Problem Description
    
We need to alphabetically order a string. For example, given the input "HiiveIsLive", the output "eehiiiilsvv" is produced.
  
We need to further extend the function to take a second input which is a custom alphabet. The input should be an ordered list of all 26 characters in any order. The function should use this alphabet for ordering the input string.
    

Solution Description
    
The input box is for the string to be ordered. The first button orders the string in a case-insensitive manner. The second button orders the string in a case-sensitive manner.
    
The checkbox enables the second input for part 2. 
    
The second input is the custom alphabet. The second input is a string of 26 characters, each character is a letter of the alphabet. The second input is used to order the string.
    
Extras : Case sensitive ordering, and multiple words can be ordered at once (input the words seperated by coma).
